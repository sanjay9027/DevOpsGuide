# Operate & Monitoring [SRE]

---

- Difference between DevOps & SRE
    - **DevOps**
        - Its all about culture & using set of tools to build a workflow for teams
        - Typical DevOps pipeline looks like creating clusters, monitoring different teams, configuring a smooth workflow for various teams in an organisation
        - DevOps is more generalised in the way of selecting & using the tools
    - **SRE**
        - It boils down to a certain product & making the system more reliable
        - An SRE may be within a particular team to check for the reliability of the system performance, that is everything working fine & reporting some potential bugs/ alerts that could happen!
        - Its a distillation of the DevOps practices
        - SRE focuses on a specific set of tools
- Why to care about SRE & SRE related practices?
    - Its a very practical implementation of the DevOps practices & culture
    - Focused on the reliability of the system
    - Automation plays an important role here!
    - DevOps is basically a toolkit, where you learn about different tools & making CI/CD pipelines etc.
        - SRE is the practical implementation of all those tools & your learnings
