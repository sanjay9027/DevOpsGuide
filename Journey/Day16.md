# Internet - History & the Big Picture

---

- **Q. What do we mean by Computer Network?**
    - Computers connected together & communicating with each other
- `**COMPUTER**` → Commonly Oriented Machine Particularly Used For Training Education & Research

---

- What is Internet?
    - Collection of these computer networks
    - On a global scale, these connection collectively are known as Internet

### How it all started - The Internet

**History**

- During the time of the **Cold War (USA vs Soviet Union)**
- Very 1st satellite by Russia → **Sputnik**
- USA started a program called `**ARPA**`
    - Advanced Research Project Agency
- **`ARPA-Net`** →  Internal network that was built to communicate between different centers of ARPA
    - Total centers that ARPA had: (connected with each other)
        1. MIT
        2. Stanford
        3. UCLA
        4. University Of Utah
- ARPA-Net used `**TCP**` (Transmission Control Protocol)

---

- What is a protocol? (In simple terms)
    - We are trying to send different types of things using the internet
    - Certain **rules** are set up by people & organisations, for transfering any amount of data across the internet
        - Called as **Protocols**

### WWW - World Wide Web

- Co-invented by **Tim Berners-Lee**
- To be able to share as many documents as possible & all of them connected through a link
- WWW basically stores all these documents (being sent over through the internet) & allows to access them through a **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**

- [World’s first website →](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

- These pages are published by **Web-servers**
- Now, the search feature was not available here & we could not scale the applications due to this!
    - Search Engines like **Yahoo** was developed for this

### Client-Server Architecture

- **Localhost** → the same computer is acting as a server & a client

### Protocols

- In order to communicate with one another over the internet, its important to have & follow set of rules & regulations.
- **Q. Who writes all these rules?**
    - The [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/)
- Some of the basic protocols:
    1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
        - Ensures that the data is reached to the destination without being corrupt or compromised
    2. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
        - used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.
        - Loss-tolerating → means that it can handle some loss of data while being transferred
            
            Example: Streaming audio & video
            
    3. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
        - Used by WWW
        - Defines the format of the data transfer between clients & servers
